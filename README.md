# Futuristic Antivirus System

A comprehensive, AI-powered antivirus solution with advanced threat detection capabilities.

## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layer Detection
- **Signature-based scanning**: Traditional hash-based malware detection
- **Heuristic analysis**: Pattern-based detection for suspicious files
- **AI-powered anomaly detection**: Machine learning model for identifying unusual file behavior
- **Cloud threat intelligence**: Real-time global threat database integration
- **Advanced sandboxing**: Isolated execution environment for behavior analysis

### üîç Real-Time Monitoring
- File system monitoring with automatic threat detection
- Real-time alerts for new threats
- Continuous background scanning

### üåê Web-Based GUI
- Modern dashboard for system management
- Scan scheduling and results viewing
- Log monitoring and quarantine management
- API endpoints for integration

### üìä Advanced Analytics
- Threat trend analysis
- Predictive prevention capabilities
- Collaborative threat reporting

## Installation

### As a Windows Application
Since PyInstaller encounters issues with Python 3.14, the system is fully functional as a Python script. To run:

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the system: `python main.py --help`

For a packaged executable, consider using an older Python version (e.g., 3.11) or alternative packagers like auto-py-to-exe.

### From Source
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/futuristic-antivirus.git
cd futuristic-antivirus
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the system:
```bash
# Start the web GUI
python main.py --gui

# Or run command-line scanning
python main.py --scan <path>

# Real-time monitoring
python main.py --monitor <path>
```

## Usage

### Web Interface
Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` for:
- Performing scans
- Viewing logs and quarantined files
- System configuration

### Command Line
```bash
# Scan a specific file or directory
python src/antivirus.py

# Real-time monitoring
python src/monitor.py
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /scan`: Initiate a scan
- `GET /logs`: Retrieve system logs
- `GET /quarantine`: View quarantined files
- `POST /update_signatures`: Update threat signatures

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:
- Scan paths and timeouts
- AI model parameters
- Cloud API settings
- Monitoring paths
