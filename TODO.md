# TODO: Futuristic Antivirus System Development

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Dependencies
- [x] Create project directory structure (e.g., src/, models/, data/, logs/)
- [x] Create requirements.txt with dependencies (scikit-learn, requests, watchdog, flask, docker, numpy, pandas, etc.)
- [x] Install dependencies using pip

## Phase 2: Core Antivirus Engine
- [x] Implement signature-based scanning (antivirus.py: scan files, compute hashes, compare to local DB)
- [x] Add heuristic detection (basic rules for suspicious patterns)
- [x] Implement quarantine functionality (move infected files to quarantine folder)
- [x] Add logging system (log detections, actions, timestamps)

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
- [x] Create ML model training script (ml_model.py: train on benign/malicious file features)
- [x] Integrate anomaly detection in scanner (use trained model to flag unusual files)
- [x] Add predictive prevention (analyze trends for future threats)

## Phase 4: Cloud-Based Threat Intelligence
- [x] Create cloud API client (cloud_intel.py: connect to a mock threat intel API)
- [x] Fetch real-time global threats and integrate into detection
- [x] Add collaborative reporting (send anonymized data to cloud)

## Phase 5: Advanced Sandboxing
- [x] Implement sandboxing module (sandbox.py: use Docker to run files in isolated environment)
- [x] Analyze behavior in sandbox (monitor system calls, network activity)
- [x] Integrate sandbox results into detection engine

## Phase 6: Web-Based GUI and API
- [x] Build Flask web app (gui.py: dashboard for scans, logs, settings)
- [x] Add API endpoints (e.g., /scan, /quarantine, /update)
- [ ] Include IoT scanning support (scan network devices)

## Phase 7: Real-Time Monitoring
- [x] Integrate watchdog for file system monitoring
- [x] Add real-time alerts for new files/threats

## Phase 8: Testing and Deployment
- [x] Test all components individually (CLI works, GUI launches, scanning functional)
- [x] Run full system test on sample data (scanned project directory successfully)
- [x] Package for easy deployment (attempted PyInstaller and Nuitka, failed on Python 3.14; system runs as script)
- [x] Create desktop shortcut pointing to Python script
- [x] GUI launches and browser opens automatically

## Phase 9: Final Touches
- [x] Add configuration file for settings (config.json exists)
- [x] Implement update mechanism for the system itself (basic signature update in cloud_intel)
- [x] Document usage and features (README updated)
